<h1>IMAGE ENCRYPTION</h1>
<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
    When sending data to a receiver through a communication channel or line the data can be intercepted by third party. So we design a algorithm to encrypt the data into block of codes that can never be understood by third party, and for receiver we have a counter inverse algorithm of encryption so the data can be decoded at the receiver end in this way data is safely transported.

<h1> Description</h1>
   <p> The image is read by Matlab by using a simple command: imread</p>

   <h1> Encryption:</h1>
   <p> We encrypted the image by dividing the pixels into multiple layers and blocks by using Matlab coding.
    The code is separated and dispersed into multiple layers so no one will be able to read what actually the data is and counter algorithm is too hard to code so in this way data is transmitted safely.
   </p>
<h1> Decryption</h1>
    <p>
    For decryption of the data we simply applied the inverse of the algorithm we used to code the encryption.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Conclusion:
    By doing this project we learnt how we can secure our data and learnt the process of encryption and decryption and being a computer science student how we can use it as for protection of data. We learnt the basics of MATLAB and  different codes of it and their working.
