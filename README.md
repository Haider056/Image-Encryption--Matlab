 <h1>IMAGE ENCRYPTION</h1>
    <p> The image is read by Matlab by using a simple command: imread</p>
        <H1>Encryption</H1>
       <p> We encrypted the image by dividing the pixels into multiple layers and blocks by using Matlab coding.
        The code is separated and dispersed into multiple layers so no one will be able to read what actually the data is and counter algorithm is too hard to code so in this way data is transmitted safely.</p>
       <h1> Decryption</h1>
   <p> For decryption of the data we simply applied the inverse of the algorithm we used to code the encryption.
